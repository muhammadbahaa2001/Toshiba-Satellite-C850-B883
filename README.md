# Toshiba-Satellite-C850-B883
This EFI was made and tested on a Toshiba Satellite C850-B883, but it should work on any Ivy Bridge laptop. You might need to make some modifications to make it work for your laptop.

# Notes
After more than 20 attempts, I finally figured out how to create a custom EFI for it. The idea was to copy some keys and values from a pre-made Clover config and then build the rest of the config based on Broadwell, as explained in the Dortania guide.

This EFI includes some specific modifications to on Dell laptops only. If you want to use it with non-Dell devices, you'll need to disable certain values in the config.plist. If you're unsure which values to disable, this website can help you: https://sc.ocutils.me/
